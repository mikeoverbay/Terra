# Terra

World of Tanks map off line viewer and battle design tool.

## Gerneral info

Writen in VB.net using Visual Studio 13.

### Sorta working! I have been working tro fix it!

Dont forget to trun on Hi Rez Terrain under Settings->Graphics.

THE MSI IS BUILT!!

Most everything has a problem!

DO NOT REPORT BUGS! I am more than aware of the problems.</br>


There are many things that need to be sorted out.

Atlas maps for the terrain and buildings.

GMM deferred rendering.

Finish decrypting all the data to place itmes on the map including water on all maps.

I am going to have to go to LOD selection of the models. Terra is going to be to slow at rendering once the textures are added to the terrain and models. They have removed the merged models and now only use models split up to trash parts of them.

I am commiting this so Maxim can have a look at the code.


I am looking for help with this project

The code is 100% mine other than the referenced DLLs.. Look in the Info.html for information on what DLLs im using and who wrote them.
