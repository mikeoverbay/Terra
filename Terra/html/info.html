  <span class="style15">Terra has undergone a complete rewrite of the rendering process.</span><br />
  Before, everything was done doing what is known as &quot;Forward Rendering&quot;.<br />
  Now.. it is done using &quot;<a href="https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/articles/forward-rendering-vs-deferred-rendering--gamedev-12342">Deferred Rendering</a>&quot;. The advantage of this method is<br />
the lighting caculations are done only on the pixels that are visible on the screen.<br />
This saves a lot of time and speeds things up drastically. Also, you can have many<br />
lights in the scene. As of now, there is only main light.. the Sun light position and<br />
the added lights of the lamps. (My hack) <br />
I added FXAA anti-aliasing to the final stage and the results are acceptable.<br />
There are newer and better versions of FXAA coming out so in time this will be improved.<br />
The down side to Deferred Rendering is the memory the buffers use. This is the first version<br />
of the new rendering pipeline and will be improved as time allows.<br />
Decals are now projected and use NO mesh what so ever to render them.<br />
They are painted directly
  on the terrain and other objects. This is a farily complicated process because<br />
  they must be blended and the normal maps
  have to be blended as well.<br />
  This requires 2 full buffer reads per render loop.<br />
  My GTX 660 Ti has no problem handling this but slower, low memory cards<br />
might choke on the bandwidth required. </p>
<p><span class="style6">When you first start up Terra!, you may need to set the path to the World of Tanks root folder.<br />
  </span>You can do this under the File menu item. After you navigate to the folder &quot;World of Tanks&quot; and click OK, Terra! will close.<br />
This is because many of the GUI items need to load in order for Terra! to run correctly. Terra! will remember this path so you wont need to set it every time you start Terra! </p>
<p>World of Tanks will need to ne installed on the system you run Terra! on. </p>
<p><span class="style6">Things you need to remember!!</span><br />
The <span class="style8">RED</span> ring is always &quot;Side One&quot; or &quot;I&quot; and the <span class="style10">GREEN</span> ring is always side &quot;II&quot;.<br />
You can change the Mini Map size using &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot;.<br />
You can also change the Mini Map tank icon sizes using Ctrl  + &quot;+&quot; and Ctrl + &quot;-&quot;.</p>
<p>There are a number of settings that control what's rendered and with what quality.<br />
  These are intended to make the rendering work 'good enough' on older systems.<br />
There are a couple of settings like, showing the chuck boarders and map grid that is just for fun and not very useful.<br />
Unless you tell Terra! to use billboard trees, it will use full 3D models of them extracted from the ctree files. This can hurt render time and slow things down.<br />
Setting the tress to low quality will speed things up. Also, there is a setting to stop the loading of all the extra environment items such as curbs,  light posts.. tables.. chairs.. anything that isn't part of the terrain or a building. This will reduce the load on the rendering engine and speed things up as well (More FPS is a good thing!)
<br />
  <span class="style6">NOTE:</span> Changing the texture quality to low, only effects maps loaded after the change in that setting.<br />
  The Textures will be resized when loaded to a maximum of 256 pixels wide. This can save render time as well as a lot of memory.<br />
  <br />
  <span class="style6">The current Sector is displayed at the bottom left of the rendering window.<br />
  </span>-------------------------------------------------------------- </p>
<p><span class="style6">Team Layout:</span><br />
  Clicking on the 'Team Layout' button will open the team layout panel.<br />
  There are 2 teams.. as in the game.. <span class="style8">Red</span> and <span class="style9">Green</span>.<br />
In order to deploy a tank, you must first assign a position to one of the team lists.<br />
Once you have selected an open position, decide on what tank you want and then click it on the right side.<br />
This will move that tank to that position in the team's list you selected first. You can replace any tank in the team lists at any time. <br />
There are a number of tanks from each nation you can chose from. I  selected some of the most common tanks for CWs and a few other lower tiers for good measure.<br />
<span class="style6">NOTE:</span> The tank will be placed where the cursor is, facing the same direction you are looking.<br />
By position the cursor and camera, you can place tanks with out having to rotate them after but in most cases, you will need to. <br />
If you do need to move a tank.. <span class="style6">You can select a tank two ways..</span> either center click it with the mouse or select it on the layout list. The team layout list MUST be visible to select tanks. <br />
Selecting tanks that are already on the layout list will place the cursor at that tanks location. You can quickly move tanks anywhere on the map by selecting one and than clicking the minimap. This will move that tank to where you clicked on the map. <br />
A selected tank will be <span class="style7">Yellow</span> in color . Once a tank is selected.. there are a few ways to move it.<br />
<span class="style6">You can press and hold the T key and move the tank around by dragging it with the mouse.. You can also rotate the tank by holding down the R key and dragging the mouse..</span>. There also is the option of using the mini map to move the tank anywhere on the map.<br />
<br />
So the basic process of creating a team goes like this.<br />
1. Decide where you want your tanks.<br />
2. Pick a 'open' spot in that team's list and then..<br />
3. Pick a tank from the list of tanks.<br />
4. Deselect that tank by middle mouse clicking anywhere but on a tank. <br />
  5. Move the cursor to where you want the next tank (SHIFT + MOUSE DRAG) and pick the next open team position, select the tank for it and .. keep repeating this until all your tanks are placed where you like them. If you don't like where a tank is, move it by selecting it and moving and rotating it to how you like. You can reset the layout by clicking.. Oddly enough.. the Reset Layout menu item.. This will ask you if you are 100% sure as it can NOT be undone. Once you have your teams the way you like, Save it.. I would use names like &quot;Air Field-Plan A&quot;  or &quot;Fjords Setup 1&quot; or.. you could even include a date. <br />
  <span class="style6">NOTE:</span> The engine does not care where you place a tank.. Be aware that in the game, there are places tanks can NEVER get to so placing tanks on top of a mountain may look cool, in the real world of tanks, a tank could never make it there.<br />
</p>
<p><span class="style6">WANs, LANs and Sessions.<br />
</span><span class="style6"><span class="style17">All of this has proven to be problematic and near useless.<br />
  I should remove it all at some point. You are still welcome to try it out. </span><br />
</span>Terra! has a build in server which allows your Clan mates to participate in the design process.<br />
The Server and Client base code is from a man with the name of Lidgren. It is a fantastic DLL which makes multi-client supported servers much easier to implement. <br />
  <span class="style6">To host a session</span>, click 'Host a Session' from the Session menu item.<br />
This will open up the server controller.<br />
Although this window is small, there is a tremendous amount of code behind it. <br />
  WAN = Wide Area Network.<br />
  LAN = Local Area Network. <br />
  On this control, there are a couple of buttons that are links to get help you may need. Port Forwarding and also an easy way to find your 'out side IP' or WAN.<br />
  If you don't know what Port Forwarding is, you need to read up at the link that button will take you to. <span class="style6">Terra! uses port number 1956.<br />
  Basically, port forwarding maps a port to a particular IP on your LAN. It is usually best to <a href="http://portforward.com/networking/static-win7.htm" target="_blank">setup a Static IP</a> on the computer you will host Terra! on or any other application that has a port mapped to that machine. </span><br />
  You will need to know your WAN in order for others to connect to Terra!.When people connect to you, they will enter your WAN IP. Port forwarding will pass the port to your computer and the connection will be made. <br />
  LAN addresses always look like this: 192.168.xx.xx. Don't get this confused with WAN addresses. The Host server will listen on the IP that says 'Your WAN IP'. If this address is not correct, the host will be listening but not on your actual IP and so.. it wont be able to detect any in coming connection request.<br />
  Terra! will remember what you put in the setup boxes so you wont need to do it every time.. However.. If your IP changes for what ever reason, Terra! has no way of knowing this and you will need to update the IP box. You will also notice there is a box for a password. The Server will reject any connection attempt that does not match this password. Keep the password simple.. Its just to stop anyone from accidentally logging in using port 1956. You will also see there is a Diagnostics button. This will show some info while the server is running such as.. the ping for each client that has connected and any strange errors that might show up. Once you have everything setup.. Click the Start Button....<br />
The server will Minimize to the task bar and the client chat window will appear. If you are connecting to some one else's computer, Put the IP of that computer in the 'Host to connect to' box. If you are hosting a session.. put in this IP: 127.0.0.1 &lt;-- this is the loop back address and will save network bandwidth. You can of course use the WAN or LAN IP for the local server though I don't recommend it. <span class="style6">If you are joining a session.. you need the IP of the computer you are connecting to and the password that was assigned.</span></p>
<p>You can setup a remote server by downloading and installing the server on your VPS or any computer you chose. Setup its IP.. Password and start it.<br />
To connect to the remote server as the host, use &quot;Join Remote as Host&quot; from the Session drop down menu. You may need to setup port forwarding if this server is part of your LAN. </p>
<p>If you are the one Hosting a Session, your name will be Red in the client list.. Other wise, it will be Black.<br />
Who ever is the current drive will be displayed in Yellow. </p>
<p>If you try to connect to remote server as the host and the there is already someone hosting on that server, you will be disconnected and a message will show up in the Diag. area. </p>
<p><span class="style6">Passing the Driving control. </span><br />
  One of the things I designed in to Terra! is the ability to pass the driving control to some one else.<br />
  How this works is, If you are the host OR the current driver, you can reassign who has driving control by Clicking on one of the client names. The controlling person's name will be yellow. Drivers can move around on the map.. move the tanks and change the tank layout. Only the host can force a map reload or force a team layout reset. <br />
  Only the Host can pass the control to another but if he/she does,.. that person can  pass the control on to some one else. The Host ALWAYS has the ability to take the control away or reassign it to some one else. Once the control is passed, that person has no more control over driving.<br />
  In the event that the current driver disconnects, the Host will become the driver automatically. If the host times out or disconnects.. If the server was local on the host's computer, the session is over because the server was started by the host. The host can reconnect using the &quot;Join Remote as Host&quot; if the server is remote. </p>
<p>The chat window is the same as any other you will find.. Type.. press enter to send. You can use SHIFT+ ENTER to break lines before sending.<br />
  The Server buffers 10 chat messages so when you connect, you can see the conversation that has be taking place. <br />

  All Data.. Models and Textures(except a few I got of the internet) come from with in the game's .pkg files. This data is owned by War Gaming.<br />
  Except for the tank models, all data is loaded either at the start of Terra! or when a map is selected.<br />
  The Tank's are from the game data but I changed their data format to speed load times. (Terra! doesn't need textures on the tanks or bump mapping. It would slow down the load time of tanks and use far too much memory. Be sides.. I like the 'plastic' board game look they have..) I used Tank Exporter to create the tanks in one batch. Look on GitHub if you are interested in that app. <br />
</p>
<p>I do this as a hobby... I work many hours figuring out how this stuff works and share my work on <a href="https://github.com/mikeoverbay">GitHub</a> so others might create projects of their own.<br />
