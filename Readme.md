# Terra

World of Tanks map off line viewer and battle design tool.

## Gerneral info

Writen in VB.net using Visual Studio 13.

The code is rough and needs cleaned up and well commented.
There are many unused functions and subs that are lingering
in the code. Entire Modules containing code I started on like
modDeferred.vb that are for setting up a FBO was started and never
used... yet.

I am looking for help with this project to clean it up and find ways
to speed up the rendering. A good start would be a getting all the 
shaders coded in 330 core. as it is now, its a hatbox of mixed versions.

The code is 100% mine other than the referenced DLLs.. Look in the Info.html
for information on what DLLs im using and who wrote them.
